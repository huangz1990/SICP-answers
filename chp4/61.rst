练习 4.61
============

规则如下::

  (rule (?x next-to ?y in (?x ?y . ?u)))

  (rule (?x next-to ?y in (?v . ?z))
        (?x next-to ?y in ?z))

`(?x next-to ?y in (1 (2 3) 4))` 的结果如下::

  (1 next-to (2 3) in (1 (2 3) 4))
  ((2 3) next-to 4 in (1 (2 3) 4))

`(?x next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))` 的结果如下::

  (2 next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))
  (3 next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))
